              <h2>Biography</h2>
              <p>For as long as I remember i always had interest in cosmetology. I would sit and watch everyone get their hair done, that was a way of me learning. As I learned i began doing hairstyles on my friends/family.</p>

               My favorite webpages are Twitter, and Instagram. They both entertain at times when im bored and have nothing else to do. It keeps me updated with the latest hot news. A fun fact abut me is that besides hair I also love to sing.
