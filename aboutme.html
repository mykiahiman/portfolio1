              <h2>Biography(AboutMe!)</h2>
              <p>I am Mykiah. As of today July 14, 2017 I am 16 years old. These past 15 years have been hard. Growing up for me was kind of hard. My anger/attitude got in between me and my mom relationship. My mom is my everything but sometimes I want to kill her and the next I love her so much and never want to leave her alone. Yes, I regret the things that happened in the past but nothing will ever change I can only learn from it. Over the years i've worked on my attitude has gotten better and I got on track, until I hit high school. When I got to highschool I though I was so grown and controlled everything. I disrespected teachers and did what I want. In the end it only hurt me and nobody else, I got kept back. The next year I got back on track and got honor roll. I was so proud of myself until I got into a fight and got put out of school. Since I got put out for the rest of the year I failed and they were trying to keep me back again, I was heated. I than left that school and went to a public school. Now that I was transferred I am now back in my correct grade, I started doing hair (something I love). Also, I was accepted for "Girls Who Code". I am so proud of myself just because I thought I would never get nowhere in life with my actions. Girls Who Code is an great opportunity and I refused to Decline my spot here this summer. Through everything I went through I am happy lol. I've been making lots of money and money makes my heart melt <3!</p>
