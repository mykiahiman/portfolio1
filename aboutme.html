<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>MyKiah</p>
<hr>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>For as long as I remember i always had interest in cosmetology. I would sit and watch everyone get their hair done, that was a way of me learning. As I learned i began doing hairstyles on my friends/family.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Likes and Dislike</h2>
<p>I love new hairstyles and I hate bad old messy hairstyles.

</body> My favorite webpages are Twitter, and Instagram. They both entertain at times when im bored and have nothing else to do. It keeps me updated with the latest hot news. A fun fact abut me is that besides hair I also love to sing.
